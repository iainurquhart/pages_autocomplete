### Donations

You can use all my code without paying anything. Having said that - if my code saves you some time and trouble, and you feel like making a small donation to help fund my trip to EECI in October 2011 - you can purchase a copy of [Introvert](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/introvert/), or ['Plates](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/plates/) from Devot:ee :)
